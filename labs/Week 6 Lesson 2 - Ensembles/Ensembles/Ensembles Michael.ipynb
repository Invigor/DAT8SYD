    "**Ensemble learning (or \"ensembling\")** is simply the process of combining several models to solve a prediction problem, with the goal of producing a combined model that is more accurate than any individual model. For **classification** problems, the combination is often done by majority vote. For **regression** problems, the combination is often done by taking an average of the predictions.\n",
